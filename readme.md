To start the program you have to run this command to start the server:
```console
go run server/server.go
```

and then this command to create a client:
```console
go run server/server.go
```


```console
go run server/server.go -port 5454
```

## Important Notes
* Every time you update the proto file, you have to run the ``protoc`` command (the long command in the proto file section).
